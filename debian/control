Description: CUDA Based De-dispersion library
 Dedisp is a C library for computing the incoherent dedispersion transform
 using a GPU. It takes filterbank data as input and computes multiple
 dedispersed integrated time series at different dispersion measures. The
 application programming interface (API) is based on that of the FFTW library,
 and should be familiar to users of that package.
